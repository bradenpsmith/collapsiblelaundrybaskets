  <h2>What Personal Data We Collect and Why</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use privacy-friendly analytics (for example Google Analytics or Plausible) 
    to understand which pages are popular. These tools collect anonymized usage data such as pages visited,
    browser type, and general location (city/region), but never your name or exact address.</li>

    <li><strong>Contact Form or Email:</strong> If you contact us directly, we’ll receive your name,
    email address, and whatever information you include in your message. 
    This data is used only to reply and is not shared or sold.</li>

    <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We may use cookies or similar technologies to remember preferences,
    measure performance, and support affiliate tracking. You can clear or block cookies through your browser settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Affiliate Links & Disclosures</h2>
  <p>
    CollapsibleLaundryBasket.com participates in affiliate programs such as the
    <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong> and others.
    When you click a product link and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission—at no extra cost to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    These links help keep the site running and the laundry puns coming.
    We do not have access to any personal or payment information you provide to retailers.

    Articles may include embedded content (like videos, images, or widgets).
    Embedded content behaves exactly as if you visited the other website directly,
    which may collect data about you, use cookies, or track your interaction.
