# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 2025_

At **CollapsibleLaundryBaskets.com**, we take your privacy almost as seriously as we take collapsible laundry baskets. (So, very seriously.)

## Information We Collect

We collect minimal data:
- Basic analytics data via **Google Analytics** (page views, device type, approximate location, etc.).
- Anonymous affiliate link clicks to see which products people actually like.

We do **not** collect personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily email or contact us.

## How We Use Your Information

- To understand which articles people read (so we can write fewer bad ones).
- To monitor site performance and fix bugs.
- To earn a small commission if you click through an affiliate link and make a purchase — at no extra cost to you.

## Cookies

We use cookies for Google Analytics and affiliate tracking. You can block or clear them anytime in your browser settings, but then we won’t know that you loved reading about collapsible baskets.

## Affiliate Disclosure

Some links on this site are affiliate links, meaning we may earn a commission if you purchase through them. This doesn’t affect the price you pay — it just helps fund our relentless research into which basket folds best.

## Third-Party Services

We rely on third-party tools like:
- **Google Analytics** — to understand how visitors interact with our site.
- **Affiliate networks** — to track referrals and pay commissions.

Each third-party provider has its own privacy policy and data handling practices.

## Data Security

This site runs on GitHub Pages and uses SSL encryption. We do not store any sensitive data locally or on third-party servers.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this Privacy Policy (usually because a lawyer said we should), we’ll post the new version right here.

## Contact

For any privacy concerns, you can reach us at **privacy@collapsiblelaundrybaskets.com**.

**TL;DR:** We don’t sell your data, we use basic analytics, and the only thing we track is which collapsible basket you might buy next.
