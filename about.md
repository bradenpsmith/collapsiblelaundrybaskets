  <h1>The World’s Greatest (and Only) Collapsible Laundry Basket Review Department.</h1>
  <p class="sub">
    There’s no lab, no interns, and certainly no grant funding - just one person, a Wi-Fi connection,
    and an unhealthy fascination with collapsible household goods.

  <h2>Our Extremely Serious Mission</h2>
  <p>
    To bring order to the wild west of collapsible laundry baskets.  
    We sift through hundreds of product listings, pore over user photos, and
    read more Amazon reviews on laundry baskets than any human ever should - all to answer
    the question: <strong>which basket actually folds and which just says it does?</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Our 'Research' Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the internet.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Read every customer complaint ever written (ever, anywhere).</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Eliminate anything that cracked, collapsed, or smelled weird.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pretend this is science.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    That’s it. No fancy lab coats - just data-driven laziness at its finest.

  <h2>Why Bother?</h2>
  <p>
    Because the world deserves better laundry baskets.  
    And because someone had to compile all those reviews into something readable
    instead of making you scroll through 12,000 nearly identical listings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is simple: save you time, spare you buyer’s remorse,
    and maybe make you laugh once or twice along the way.

  <h2>Who’s Behind This?</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, that’s me — the self-appointed <strong>World’s Greatest Authority on Collapsible Laundry Baskets</strong>.
    I’m just a normal person who appreciates good baskets and sarcasm.
  </p>
  <p>
    I earn a small commission when you buy through affiliate links, which helps keep
    the lights on and the sarcasm flowing. It doesn’t affect which baskets I recommend -
    only how much coffee I can afford while writing about them.

  <h2>Footnote (for legal and comedic reasons)</h2>
  <p style="color:var(--muted);font-size:.9rem;">
    * “Research” may involve zero physical testing and 100% scrolling through reviews.  
    Still more thorough than most of the internet.
